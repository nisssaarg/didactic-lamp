/*
Input Format
First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Next T lines contains an integer N denoting the maximum price of the item present Philaland.


Output Format
For each test case print a single line denoting the minimum number of denominations of coins required.


Constraints
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=5000


Refer the Sample Output Formatting

Sample Input:

      2
     10
      5

Sample Output:

     4
     3

Explanation:

For test case 1, N=10.
According to Manish {$1, $2, $3,â€¦ $10} must be distributed.
But as per Manisha only {$1, $2, $3, $4} coins are enough to purchase any item ranging from $1 to $10. Hence minimum is 4. Likewise denominations could also be {$1, $2, $3, $5}. Hence answer is still 4.


For test case 2, N=5.
According to Manish {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5} must be distributed.
But as per Manisha only {$1, $2, $3} coins are enough to purchase any item ranging from $1 to $5. Hence minimum is 3. Likewise denominations could also be {$1, $2, $4}. Hence answer is still 3.
